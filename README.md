This repository contains the code needed to run experiments from my paper "On Optimal Strategies for Wordle and General Guessing Games", published in IJCAI-2023 (link to come).

This code was originally used as part of my university honour's thesis "Solving Wordle With AI". I have (significantly) cleaned up the code since then, though those versions can be found in the git history.  This thesis also covered much more than the paper is able cover, such as optimizing for "the worst possible score", as well as playing simultaneous Wordle games.
