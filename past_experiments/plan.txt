Recap
- G, S, C
- Using OldWordle word set, but can transition current work to new word set
- Reason: All previous work from last term was also done using this

Current
- Combining valuations
    - Most papers tested a single valuation at a time
    - Determining what to go next
    - In terms of tie breaks, Knuth suggested taking firstValid, then alphabetical
    - Kooi suggested same thing
    - We'll try to use multiple valuations, assigning an array of scores, and sorting lexicographically
    - Show that there was an effect
- New valuations
    - Unlike Mastermind, Wordle characters to do not have same frequency
    - Show plots of that
    - Two new ones:
        - CharFreq
        - ProbsGreen
        - EvenSplit (like HigherLower)
- Specifics of Hard Mode
    - Example game with Hard Mode
    - We have to use all 'positive' information, we can ignore 'negative' information. i.e. we have to use all green/yellow information, but greys can be ignored
    - Set of allowed guesses also changes
    - Show results that were optimized for average
- Depth search
    - Goal is to minimize average
    - Show same formula that K&L used
    - Show new framework
    - Explain MAX_BREADTH parameter
    - Show run times
- Optimzing worst
    - For now we've only been trying to minimize for Average case 
    - Other one in consideration in literature (and mentioned at the end of the Thesis A presentaiton) is the Worst score
    - How do you compare Worst scores?
    - Show three plots with (6,1) (5,30) (5, 26)
    - Explain how we care about Worst, minimize max score and minimize the number with that max score
    - New formula
    - Show results on Wordle
- Other games
    - Going back to framework
    - The goal is to make techniques that work in general settings
    - Testing it on other games
    - Show table of scores + runtimes
    

Future
    - Using character frequency not just for valuation, but also using it to make shortcuts
    - Games like Dordle where C is not subset of G
    - Static Wordle
        - Finding best two starting words
        - "Best" by what metric?
        - Just testing every pair of words can be done but takes too long, need some shortcuts
